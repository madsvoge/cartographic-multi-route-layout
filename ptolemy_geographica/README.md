# Ptolemy's Geographica -> OpenStreetMap

`ptolemy_map.py` extracts the geographical references (place names and
coordinates) recorded in Claudius Ptolemy's 2nd-century *Geographica* and
plots them as an interactive map on OpenStreetMap tiles.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 ptolemy_map.py --open
```

This reads the bundled sample data and writes `ptolemy_map.html`, an
interactive Leaflet/OpenStreetMap page with a marker (and popup: name,
book/tabula, ancient and modernized coordinates) for every reference found.

## Data

- `data/petri-munster-1540-hibernia.csv` — a small bundled sample (the
  "Hiberniae Insulae" table of the 1540 Petri/Münster edition), in the
  open-data schema published by the
  [Ptolemy-Geography project](https://github.com/Lorp/Ptolemy-Geography):
  `book,map,subheading,placename,longitude,longitude-min,latitude,latitude-min`.
- Point `--input` at a directory (or additional CSV files in the same
  schema) to plot more of the Geographica as more of its ~8,000 entries get
  digitized upstream, e.g.:

  ```bash
  python3 ptolemy_map.py --input data/ more_tables/ --output map.html
  ```

- `--text some_edition.txt` will additionally regex-scan a freeform/plain
  text file for `name  lon-deg lon-min  lat-deg lat-min` style lines. This
  is a best-effort heuristic — use `--dry-run` first to review what it
  extracted before trusting it.

## Coordinate conversion

Ptolemy's latitude is measured from the equator, same as today, so it's
used as-is. His longitude is measured east of a prime meridian at the
"Fortunate Isles" (roughly El Hierro / Ferro in the Canaries), so it's
converted to a Greenwich-relative longitude by subtracting the meridian's
offset (`--ferro-offset`, default 17.6667°).

This is only an approximate modernization. Ptolemy underestimated the
Earth's circumference, so his coordinates are systematically stretched and
skewed relative to reality — worse the further from the Mediterranean.
Treat the plotted points as "where Ptolemy claimed the place was", not
ground truth.

## CLI options

```
--input PATH [PATH ...]   CSV file(s)/directories to load (default: bundled sample)
--text PATH [PATH ...]    Plain-text file(s) to regex-extract references from
--output PATH             Output HTML map path (default: ptolemy_map.html)
--ferro-offset DEGREES    Ferro-to-Greenwich meridian offset (default: 17.6667)
--open                    Open the resulting map in a browser
--dry-run                 Print extracted references instead of building a map
```
